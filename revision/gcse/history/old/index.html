      Changes: The bloody code reached a peak of 222 in 1810, however the government realised that deterrence was not working. They therefore decided to change punishments to fit the crimes. This meant that the punishment would be equal to the crime committed. Punishments would also try different methods, such as prisons. They were considering to do rehabilitate people, so they become better people. They also realised that capital and corporal punishments should only be used for the most serious of crimes. <o p="#DEFAULT" /></p></div></li>

      Transportation: America decided to go independent, this therefore meant England was unable to send criminals. They had to find a new place, Australia. This made people more feared of getting this punishment as at the time people thought the world was flat, therefore they would fall of. People didn’t want to go there as well as it was an unexplored land. They didn’t know how big it worse nor what it looked like. However, in 1868 transportation ended for several reasons. Australia no longer needed labour as it had people who wanted to do it and they didn’t want any criminals. People were starting to stay after their sentence as Australia was offering better thing that England did. The gold rush made it become a desirable place, so people were starting to commit a crime, so they can get a free ticket. Transportation was also very expensive and there were better, and cheaper alternatives. Prisons were starting to be used more often so Transportation just become worthless and not feasible. <o p="#DEFAULT" /></p></div></li>

      Prisons: They were widely used in the 18th century and onwards. However, in the 18th century conditions were very poor. It consisted of harsh labour and confined spaces, and with prisons being used as punishments, they needed to reform them. <o p="#DEFAULT" /><i>See case study for more</i></p></div>

At first the charged fees and collected rewards, but they got backed by the government and got a wage. They introduced new methods to detect crime, such as using horses and evidence to bring criminals to justice. They also set up their own newspaper called the Hue and Cry which was aimed to be a newspaper with criminal’s names and pictures in hope the public would help them catch that criminal if the spot them.

      Pentonville Prison: This prison was the 'model' prison. The wings would be divided, there were thick walls to stop prisoners from talking. Areas where prisoners were sent to get fresh air, and there was 'useful' work in their room. This prison was using the separate system. The separate system was used for rehabilitation, criminals would be able to look back at the crimes they did and think what they did. They would then be able to turn to religion and change into a better person. The cell provided everything they needed. As they were in isolation this therefore served as retribution as they would get bored and 'pay' for their crime. It was a deterrent due to the boredom and mental illness it brings to you and stopped you from committing crimes. <o p="#DEFAULT" /></p></div>

      Penal Code: Robert Peel wasn’t happy with there being a lot of capital punishments during the bloody code. Therefore, he changed the amount of punishments down to 100. This was because Judges weren’t giving out many punishments and they thought it was unfair someone should die for doing a small petty crime. Robert changed this so Judges would punish criminals more, as they wouldn’t have to receive the death penalty. This reformed criminals and there were now less harsh punishments in place. <o p="#DEFAULT" /></p></div></li>

      Bloody Code: Increased amount of capital crimes. (Death penalty) Over 50 crimes had been added, this included small petty crimes.

      Transportation: Criminals would be transported to colonies in America. This was done so Britain could become a crime free country. But it didn’t work at all. They were either sent therefore 7 or 14 years and would then be released. However, most of them would be unable to afford the return journey back to England. Transportation was good as it worked as a deterrence as people would want to leave everything behind, but still allowing the to rehabilitate. It was a good alternative for execution for petty crimes in the bloody code period. It also allowed England to provide inhabitant to American colonies. <o p="#DEFAULT" /></p></div></li></ul></li>

      Reason for Witch-hunts: After the civil war it left many women widowed and on their own, sometimes with cats. There were people moving around looking for jobs, therefore more strangers. There was no control in local authorities James I had promoted witch-hunting and his Demonology booked outlined the belief of witches and how they should be hunted.
