      Transportation: Criminals would be transported to colonies in America. This was done so Britain could become a crime free country. But it didn&#8217;t work at all. They were either sent therefore 7 or 14 years and would then be released. However, most of them would be unable to afford the return journey back to England. Transportation was good as it worked as a deterrence as people would want to leave everything behind, but still allowing the to rehabilitate. It was a good alternative for execution for petty crimes in the bloody code period. It also allowed England to provide inhabitant to American colonies. <o p="#DEFAULT"></o>

      Reason for Witch-hunts: After the civil war it left many women widowed and on their own, sometimes with cats. There were people moving around looking for jobs, therefore more strangers. There was no control in local authorities James I had promoted witch-hunting and his Demonology booked outlined the belief of witches and how they should be hunted. There was a religious change in the civil war, and after the civil war it left economic problems with poor harvests.<o p="#DEFAULT"></o>

      Smuggling: Increased from 1740-1850 due to the tax on imported goods were so high. Smugglers made a lot of money due to them not paying any tax and being able to sell them at a reasonable price making the product more appealing. This soon led to large gangs smuggling in, such as Hawkhurst Gang. Mounted customs officers tried to prosecute smugglers but there was a large area of unguarded coast line. Taxes were cut in 1840s, hense smuggling decreased.<o p="#DEFAULT"></o>

      Witchcraft: After the civil war number of prosecutions declined. Most people moved on but some clung onto their beliefs. The reason why Witchcraft stopped being a crime was due to economic and social changes, people became less superstitious and the Royal Society led scientific experiments which explained a lot of things thought to be the work of witches.

      Tolpuddle Martyrs: A 'friendly Society' protested about their low wages compared to other farm workers. Government and farm owners feared losing control of the workers, so they arrested them for taking a secret oath. All found guilty and were given a 7-year transportation punishment to deter others from committing a trade union. There was a mass protest and petition of 200,00 signatures to oppose their harsh punishment. The home sectary still gave them the punishment but later pardoned them. <o p="#DEFAULT"></o>
